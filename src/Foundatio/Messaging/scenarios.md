- Multiple receivers (pub/sub)
  - Fire and forget
  - Message acknowledgement
- Worker queues
  - Single Worker
  - Round robin workers
- Delayed delivery
  - Can schedule delivery, messages are persisted to a message store and a background task polls for messages that are due and then sends them out
- Message persistence
  - Not all messages need to be persisted and guaranteed delivery
- Message subscriptions are push based with prefetch count setting which should greatly improve throughput
- Can either use generic method overloads or use options to change the message type or topic the message is being published to
- Can subscribe to multiple message types by controlling the message topic instead of using the default topic per .net type
- Request/response
  - Publishes message and then does a single message receive on a topic that is for that exact request and waits the specified amount of time
- Receive message (pull model)
  - Equivalent of current worker queues pulling a single message at a time
  - Ability to receive a batch of messages
